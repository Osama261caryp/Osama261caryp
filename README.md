With over **16 years** of experience as a Procurement & Supply Chain Leader, I specialize in:

- Procurement optimization  
- Inventory centralization  
- Cross-border technology transfer  
- MEP logistics and ERP systems  

📌 I was the first to lead the technology transfer of dry-type transformers from China to the Middle East, and I've served as Board Chairman in three Egyptian firms in the industrial supply space.
